      "2.1 Creativity as a driver of Innovation  \n",
      "Creativity is a complex socio -psychological phenomenon that drives innovation through the \n",
      "generation of novel and useful ideas  [21], [22], [23] . The creative process encompasses problem \n",
      "identification, idea generation, and implementation [24]. Imagination seems to play an \n",
      "important role in fostering creativity - a concept emphasized by Einstein's (1929) statement \n",
      "‘Imagination is more important than knowledge’ [25] and supported by various creativity \n",
      "theories  [26], [27], [28], [29] . Creativity can be defined as a process that arises from a \n",
      "perception of the environment that recognizes a certain imbalance and leads to a productive \n",
      "activity that challenges patterned thought processes and norms and produces something new \n",
      "in the form of a  physical object or even a mental or emotional construct  [30]. Creativity emerges \n",
      "from the interplay between reproduction (knowledge and past experiences) and projection \n",
      "(imagination), triggered by perceived discrepancies in one's environment  [31]. The transition \n",
      "from creativity to innovation involves a spectrum of contributions, ranging from replication to \n",
      "integration  [32] while balancing originality and practicality  [33]. Cropley (2006) describes \n",

      "Innovation emphasizes the interplay of individual and organizational factors in the innovation \n",

      "flexibility is crucial for the development and refinement of different thought elements into \n",

      "approaches that require a comprehensive knowledge base and the ability to manipulate \n",
      "existing knowledge to develop meaningful and valuable ideas  [39], [40] . In the field of \n",
      "[40], [41], [42] . Inspirational stimuli are crucial in this process, as they foster efficient ideation \n",
      "and lead to novel, unique, and ultimately practical solutions. The impact of these stimuli on \n",
      "creativity is significant, often surpassing individual problem -solving abil ities [43], [44], [45], \n",
      "[46]. Research on group creativity shows that fear of sharing ideas and production blockages \n",
      "can hinder brainstorming, reducing both group performance and motivation  [47], [48], [49] . \n",
      "Positive outcomes are more likely when groups are exposed to diverse stimuli and ideas and \n",
      "are motivated by increased responsibility and competition  [50], [51] . Electronic brainstorming, \n",
      "particularly when groups are given more time, can reach the idea generation level of traditional \n",

      "KSTE proposes that the spillover of knowledge, particularly in entrepreneurial contexts, is \n",

      "\n",
      "## Abstract\n",
      "This paper examines the impact of generative artificial intelligence (AI) on product markets. The authors use an unanticipated leak of a highly proficient image-generative AI as a natural experiment to study the effects of generative AI on prices, order volume, and overall revenue. Surprisingly, the results show that generative AI lowers average prices but substantially boosts order volume and overall revenue. This counterintuitive finding suggests that generative AI confers benefits upon artists rather than detriments.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Introduction\n",
      "Generative AI has raised concerns about unemployment and market depression. Artists have protested against AI-generated images, and policymakers are considering regulations to limit the use of generative AI. However, there are differing views on the economic impact of generative AI. This paper aims to empirically examine the impact of generative AI on product markets to bridge the gaps in understanding.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Methods\n",
      "To overcome the challenge of causal inference, the authors use an unanticipated leak of a highly proficient image-generative AI as a natural experiment. They collect real-world data from an artwork outsourcing platform and compare the effects of generative AI on the anime-style painting market (treated unit) and the wallpaper market (control unit). They analyze the average price, order volume, and overall revenue before and after the emergence of generative AI.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Findings\n",
      "The results show that generative AI lowers the average price by 64%, but it also leads to a remarkable 121% increase in the number of orders and a 56% increase in total revenue. These findings suggest that generative AI has a positive impact on artists' income and contributes to the industry's overall prosperity.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Theoretical Explanation\n",
      "The authors provide a theoretical explanation for the counterintuitive findings using the supply and demand model. They argue that generative AI reduces demand as consumers gain the ability to satisfy their needs autonomously. However, it also increases supply as producers become more efficient. The opposing dynamics of reduced demand and increased supply converge to explain the observed empirical results.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Implications\n",
      "The findings of this paper have significant implications for practitioners, policymakers, and the AI community. Practitioners should embrace generative AI to increase efficiency and revenue. Policymakers should view the increase in total revenue as a broader tax base and encourage the utilization of generative AI. The AI community can be reassured that generative AI is augmenting humans rather than replacing them.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "This paper provides empirical evidence that generative AI, despite lowering prices, has a positive impact on order volume and overall revenue in product markets. It highlights the benefits of generative AI for artists and emphasizes the need for further research on its causal effects in different domains.\n"
