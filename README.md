## Overview

This repository provides educational resources for learning generative artificial intelligence, from foundational concepts through advanced research topics. 

## My Teaching Philosophy

*"Number is the ruler of forms and ideas, and the cause of gods and demons" â€“ Pythagoras*


### [01 - Foundations](./01-foundations/)
Mathematical and conceptual foundations of generative AI, neural network fundamentals, and statistical principles governing machine learning.

### [02 - Large Language Models](./02-large-language-models/)
Transformer architecture, training methodologies, prompt engineering, and fine-tuning techniques.

### [03 - Generative Models](./03-generative-models/)
GANs, VAEs, diffusion models, and techniques for generating images, text, and multimedia content.

### [04 - Practical Applications](./04-practical-applications/)
